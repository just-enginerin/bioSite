                <p>
                    Jerimiah’s business, The Prancing Puppy, was born from his love for rescuing animals. “I started as a child, bringing home wild animals-- whenever I found a bird with a broken wing, or a rabbit with a wounded leg, a baby animal that lost its mom-- my dad and I were renowned in our neighborhood for that. I've always found animals fascinating and connecting with them to be humbling.” He continues to save injured animals as a hobby, but his business acts as an extension of this pastime. Jerimiah is an experienced animal trainer who specializes in dogs with more difficult behavioral struggles such as aggression and biting. “In 2021, New York City animal centers took in 1,393 animals in a single month. That’s double the usual numbers.” (Stancheva, 2022) And “According to the ASPCA’s National Rehoming Survey, pet problems are the most common reason that owners rehome their pet.” (E. Weiss et al, 2015) Jerimiah believes that the effective training he provides helps prevent more animals from ending up in the shelter system or on the streets.

                <p>
                  Jerimiah is passionate about preserving the natural world. He experiences this world for himself by hiking, a hobby he’s carried with him from childhood. “I’ve always felt an automatic connection to forests and the other natural settings around me. To this day, [hiking] has really been a part of my ‘zen’—a way to reflect and grow.” Indeed, the effects of hiking on Jerimiah’s mental health is significant. “Spending quality time in the great outdoors reduces stress, calms
                  anxiety, and can lead to a lower risk of depression, according to a study done by researchers at Stanford University. In addition to having mental health benefits, being outdoors opens up your senses to your surroundings and improves your sensory perception.” (Benefits of Hiking: Trails & Hiking, 2018) His favorite hike in New York is, according to the New York State Park System, “a hard a strenuous hike… only for experienced hikers in excellent physical condition.” (Reed, 2022) In just under the first mile of the trail, hikers ascend around 1250 feet!

                    <p>
                        While on his hikes, Jerimiah enjoys capturing photos to share some of the magic of his experiences. One of his greatest influences is National Geographic wildlife photographer, Paul Nicklen. “I've been fascinated with his work since the first time I laid eyes on it. I relate to the way he captures images because I feel as though I share a similar perspective in the way I aim to photograph wildlife. It's inspiring to see visual evidence of someone viewing the world the same way I do.”
