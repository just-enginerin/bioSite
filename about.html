                <p id="p1">
                    Jerimiah Black, owner of <i>The Prancing Puppy</i>: a pet care  business in New York City,
                    was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He describes himself as “eclectically blue
                    collar,” as someone with an unconventional artistic style who carries an intense pride in his
                    physically laborious upbringing. He follows his passions for environmentalism, art, and animals
                    every day with his business and his photography while hiking through a system of 119 scenic
                    trails in the Greater New York City area.

                    <i>The Prancing Puppy</i> was founded in the middle of a crisis—at the start of the COVID-19
                    pandemic, which was devastating for New York at the time, especially for small businesses.
                    According to Smith, “For many pet care professionals, COVID-19 has been disastrous. Demand
                    for dog walking and pet sitting services dried up overnight…. If everyone is home, there is little
                    need for [them].” Not only was the demand for business low, but the risks were sky high. “We
                    go in and out of people’s homes all day long. That means we’re touching door handles, locks,
                    leashes, tables, chairs, the fridge if it’s feeding time and so on in multiple homes… so for now
                    it’s safest for everyone to refrain from doing visits that aren’t absolutely necessary.” (Smith,
                    2020) This hasn’t gotten Jerimiah down. “It’s given me the opportunity to realize who my most
                    loyal customers are, who I can depend on and how they feel about me and the care I provide….
                    [as well as] a lot more one-on-one time with each pet to form a unique bond with each one.”
